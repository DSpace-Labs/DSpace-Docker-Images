### Background

- 2018 the DSpace for Docker was created
- Possible to start any version of DSpace from your desktop
  - (Windows 10, MacOS, Linux)
- Great potential for repository managers

+++

### Who You Are (we think)

- Repository Managers who want to ...
  - preview new DSpace functionality
  - become more involved in DSpace development
  - test certain functionality of DSpace
- Developers who want to ...
  - learn how they can get started with the project
  - use DSpace within Docker as part of their development environment

+++

### Webinar Objectives

- What is a *Docker image* and what are *Containers*
- What Docker images have been published for DSpace
- How to install Docker
- How to launch DSpace 6 and DSpace 7 using Docker
- How to participate in DSpace testing using Docker

---

### Motivation

In our first demo, we want to show you how easy it is to get DSpace 7 runing. For this demo, we have already
- Installed Docker
- Installed a command line tool
- Downloaded some code to help us start DSpace

Note:
Terry presents

```shell
cd
git clone https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/DSpace-Docker-Images.git
cd DSpace-Docker-Images/docker-compose-files/dspace-compose
```

+++

### Demo: Running DSpace 7

- It takes 2-3 minutes to start up
- The following command was already run

```shell
docker-compose -p d7 -f docker-compose.yml -f d7.override.yml up -d
```

### Testing DSpace 7

- http://localhost:8080/spring-rest
- http://localhost:3000

### 5 Quick Docker Concepts

- Docker Images
- DSpace Docker Images
- Docker Containers
- Docker Volumes
- Docker compose

Note:
Pascal presents

+++

### Docker Images

- Imagine you could
  - install a complex application with its complete environment with one command
  - pack a whole environment into one package

Docker Images make that possible.

+++

### Docker Images (continued)

An Image is

- A snapshot of an application and its complete environment
- Published Online
  - On [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
  - Or in a private repository
- Can be shared and downloaded

+++

### DSpace Docker Images

- DSpace 7x, DSpace 6x, DSpace 5x, DSpace 4x
  - Install content from DSpace AIP files on creation
- DSpace Database
- DSpace Angular UI
- Published to https://hub.docker.com/r/dspace/dspace

+++

### Docker Containers

- A running version of a docker image
- Like a small server running within your desktop
- Containing a complete environment
- Containing an application or service
- Started and stopped by Docker
- Runs independently of other applications

+++

### A container's lifetime

- Images package a complete environment needed to run an application
- Containers can be deleted when they are stopped
- A container can be thrown away and recreated easily as the image defines it well

+++

### Docker Volumes

- Can be (re-)used when a container starts
- Volumes outlive the containers that uses them
- Like a really small disk drive or network drive
- Data you wish to save must be stored in a volume

+++

### docker-compose

- Docker compose is a command to control environments of multiple containers that work together
  - DSpace Database
  - DSpace Web Server
  - Angular UI (for DSpace 7)
- Build, start, stop, ... all necessary containers for a service or application

---

### What is possible with DSpace and Docker?

- Try out a DSpace feature without impacting your existing instance
- Preview an enhancement or new version
- Give input on the implementation
- Verify a bug fix **before** it is released
- Onboard new developers and repository managers to the project

---

### Install Instructions

- Install Docker Desktop
- Install a terminal for running docker
- Download DSpace Docker Compose files

Note:
