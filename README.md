# DSpace-Docker-Images

This repository contains docker resources for the [DSpace](https://dspace.org) project.
- Docker Compose files for DSpace 4x and 5x
- Special purpose Docker Compose and Dockerfiles for DSpace
- Tutorials for running DSpace with Docker and Docker Compose

References
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) simplifies the installation requirements for hosting an application by running an application image (_docker image_) within a containerized environment (_docker container_).
- [Docker Hub](https://dockerhub.com) is a registry of published application images.
- The DSpace project has published a set of [DSpace Images on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dspace/dspace) to simplify testing and development of the DSpace platform.
  - The project has automated the build of Docker Images for each of the supported branches of the DSpace code base ([build details](https://hub.docker.com/r/dspace/dspace/builds/)).
- A [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) file is used to orchestrate the launch of interdependent containers.  
  - For DSpace 4, 5 and 6, those containers are the database and tomcat (xmlui, jspui)
  - For DSpace 7, the containers are the database, tomcat (for the REST api), and Node (running the Angular UI)
- The Docker compose file manages the allocation of _docker volumes_ which persist the contents of the DSpace database and the DSpace assetstore.

## Why Publish DSpace Images for Docker?
- To enable users (developers and repository mangagers) to easily test the latest code from each of the supported branches of DSpace
- To enable users (developers and repository mangagers) to easily test the code from each published release of DSpace
- To simplify the installation requirements for developers wishing to contribute code to the DSpace platform
- To simplify the management of multiple versions of DSpace (DSpace 5, 6, and 7) on a user's desktop
- To simplify the management of applicaiton dependencies for DSpace 7 (database, REST API, Angular UI) on a user's desktop
-  __Note: These images are intended for DSpace development purposes and are not appropriate for production use.__

## Compose files
The following Docker Compose files can be used to simplify the management of DSpace components allowing a user to run an end-to-end DSpace instance from their desktop.
