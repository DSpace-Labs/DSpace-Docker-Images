# DSpace-Docker-Images

This repository contains the source code for Docker Images for the [DSpace](https://dspace.org) project.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) simplifies the installation requirements for hosting an application by running an application image (_docker image_) within a containerized environment (_docker container_).
- [Docker Hub](https://dockerhub.com) is a registry of published application images.
- The DSpace project has published a set of [DSpace Images on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dspace/) to simplify testing and development of the DSpace platform.
  - The project has automated the build of Docker Images for each of the supported branches of the DSpace code base ([build details](https://hub.docker.com/r/dspace/dspace/builds/)).
- A [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) file is used to orchestrate the launch of interdependent containers.  
  - For DSpace 4, 5 and 6, those containers are the database and tomcat (xmlui, jspui)
  - For DSpace 7, the containers are the database, tomcat (for the REST api), and Node (running the Angular UI)
- The Docker compose file manages the allocation of _docker volumes_ which persist the contents of the DSpace database and the DSpace assetstore.

## Why Publish DSpace Images for Docker?
- To enable users (developers and repository mangagers) to easily test the latest code from each of the supported branches of DSpace
- To enable users (developers and repository mangagers) to easily test the code from each published release of DSpace
- To simplify the installation requirements for developers wishing to contribute code to the DSpace platform
- To simplify the management of multiple versions of DSpace (DSpace 5, 6, and 7) on a user's desktop
- To simplify the management of applicaiton dependencies for DSpace 7 (database, REST API, Angular UI) on a user's desktop
-  __Note: These images are intended for DSpace development purposes and are not appropriate for production use.__

## Special Purpose Images

### Published Images For Cloud Environments
This table lists DSpace Docker images that have been designed to  run in specific cloud environments.  An account for a specific cloud environment is necessary to utilize these images.

| Image Name | Status | DockerHub | Labels | Compose Files | Comments |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ------------- | -------- |
| [dspace-janitor-angular](https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/DSpace-Docker-Images/tree/master/dockerfiles/dspace-janitor-angular)|Developed||||Referenced by the [Janitor](https://janitor.technology) service|

### Development Images (Source Code Only)
This table lists docker images that have been optimized for DSpace software development.  These images may be more complex to utilize.  These images require a local build from source code.

| Image Name | Status | Compose Files | Comments |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | -------- |
| [dspace-angular-dev](https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/DSpace-Docker-Images/tree/master/dockerfiles/dspace-angular-dev) | In progress | in project dir | Designed for Angular development, relies on an external REST API |
